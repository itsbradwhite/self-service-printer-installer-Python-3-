# Self Service Printer Installer

April 2022 - I updated this script to Python 3 so it will work on MacOS Monterey 12.3+

You will stil need to ship Python 3 to users, check out MacAdmins Python 3 release.


Present users with a GUI to install printers on their Mac via Self Service (with Magic‚Ñ¢)

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Warning: Batteries not included. Requires a good amount
of setup on _your_ end to save your users from the pit of despair.

This is a preliminary version of the tool which administrators at several organizations
are testing. Things may change and break quickly!
